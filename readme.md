Welcome to the code assignment. 

###### Task:

Your task is developing a small search engine that provides the 3 best matching TV series names for a given tv series name/ or part. A list of the TV series names is provided in the `resource/data.json` file. Use the content of that file as the knowledge base. You can divide the task into the following subtasks.

1. Develop an application to provide (return) the 3 best matching TV series names for a given input
2. Expose that application as an API (Use GET method)
3. Develop a simple web page for frontend users. It should contain an input box and a search button. When 
   a user types a name/part of the name of a tv series, and click the search button, it should show the 3 best matching TV
   series names from the provided data.json file
   
   This is an example. 
       
     **Note**: Your results may be different.
     
     **User input**: _games thron_
     
     **result**: 1. _Game of Thrones, 2. Maron, 3. Backstrom_
     
###### Solution delivery:

 There are two tasks

   1. Deploy the  frontend web page online (preferred way) and send us the URL. If you are unable to deploy the frontend in an online location, send us a document with the instructions to startup the front end/backend servers in a local machine.
   2. Make a zip or tar file of the entire source code and email it to careers@getshoutout.com

Deadline: You have 2 days to deliver the task. 

           Start time: 2024.01.24:1800h
           End time: 2024.01.26:1800h   

Please **go though all points before you start** the assignment.

1. What is the development language?

    Javascript - Use MERN stack 

2. Can I use existing libraries?

    Yes, please. We encourage you to use any existing libraries rather than re-inventing the wheel.

3. Can I take code pieces from the internet?

   Yes, you can. But you MUST mention the source location in the comments of the code. 

5. I don't have a cloud location to deploy the solution. What should I do?

   We encourage you to deploy the solution in a cloud location. It will be a task of the project. You may find free hosting facilities. Ex: Google is providing free $300 credits for all new users. You can have a 
   look at https://cloud.google.com/free. If you have questions regarding the deployments, we are happy to help. Please reach 
   us by email careers@getshoutout.com
   
   The alternative is sending us documentation with steps of deploying the entire solution in a local machine. (We don't recommend this method.)
   
6. I have questions/ doubts about the task. What shall I do?

   You can always write to us. Please email your concerns during the task time window to support@shoutout.ai
   
7. I couldn't finish the task before the deadline. What shall I do?

   Don't worry. Email us your current code as it is.
